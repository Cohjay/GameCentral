                <h2>Top 10 YouTube Channels</h2>
                <h3>10. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CanalKondZilla/" target="_blank">Canal KondZilla</a> (60.4m subscribers)</h3>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJw-Q71cW7BU-e3nlWkZ4CfDyDarw3pobnbn0en7jQ=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj">
                <p>Back to music, this time we’ve got Konrad Cunha Dantas’s channel Canal KondZilla.

                    Dantas is a music video producer and owner of KondZilla Records, and he posts music from KondZilla on his channel.
                    
                    Centered around the funk ostentação genre, the popularity of this music has translated well to YouTube. The channel unsurprisingly includes loads of music videos, plus some behind-the-scenes footage.</p>
                <h3>9. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJplp5SjeGSdVdwsfb9Q7lQ" target="_blank">Like Nastya Vlog</a> (60.7m subscribers)</h3>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.imglicensing.com/media/3162/likenastya-logo.png">
                <p>Kicking off the list is the most subscribed to channel in the Russian Federation. Aimed at kids it features Like Nastya, and her parents who run the channel, recreating scenes from films and TV shows, singing songs and nursery rhymes, and going on trips.

                    Like Nastya also has another channel, with 15m subscribers,  simply called ‘Like Nastya’, it puts out similar videos, but with more of a focus on playing and trips to amusement and activity parks.</p>
                <h3>8. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zeemusiccompany" target="_blank">Zee Music Company</a> (64.1m subscribers)</h3>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/29/ZeeMusicCo.jpg">
                <p>Sticking with music, we have the Indian channel Zee Music Company (also not the only Indian music channel in the list).

                    The channel’s content is made up of music videos, some of which are from films and television shows. The channel says it’s aggregated over 220k hours of video content.</p>
                <h3>7.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/kidsdianashow" target="_blank">✿ Kids Diana Show</a> (67.7m subscribers)</h3>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAkGBxAQDxUPEA8VFRAQFhUQEBUQFQ8VEBUVGBYXGBUYFhUaHiggGBslGxUXITEhJSkrLi4uFyAzODMtNygtLisBCgoKDg0OGhAQGzImICUtMC0rLS0tLS0vLzUtLS0tLjAtLS0tLS0tLS8vLS0tLS0tLS01Ly0tLS0tLS0tLS0tLf">
                <p>Children’s channels are hugely popular on YouTube, so we have a few like this in the list. This one is focused on a girl called Diana, with the content focusing on her life and what it’s like to be a kid (who is constantly filmed, I guess).

                    The videos include toy unboxings, challenges, trips out and about, and other activities that children get up to. A concept that would have sounded bizarre just a few years ago, but here we are.
                    
                    </p>
                    <h3>6. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ5v_MCY6GNUBTO8-D3XoAg" target="_blank">WWE</a> (69.5m subscribers)</h3>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwng2VI-9OA0yq7vqmH98Ug24YdX-uFnereCkqzWMBBg=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj">
                <p>WWE, or World Wrestling Entertainment, is the most popular sports channel on the list.

                    The WWE channel has recaps of recent matches, full matches, and plenty of footage from their archives, including classic fights and interviews.

                    <h3>5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC295-Dw_tDNtZXFeAPAW6Aw" target="_blank">5-Minute Crafts</a> (69.6m subscribers)</h3>

                    <p>Into the final five, and we have 5-Minute Crafts, a DIY channel that covers a whole range of subjects.

                        Originally started in 2016, it’s gone from strength to strength since and is the most subscribed to channel of its type.
                        
                        Along with craft videos, 5-Minute Crafts also includes life hacks for every part of your life, along with content for kids and parents.
                        
                        </p>
                    <h3>4. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/setindia" target="_blank">SET India</a> (82.9m subscribers)</h3>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/youtube/images/6/6c/SET_India.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180626130237">
                    <p>Into the final four and we have Sony Entertainment Television, or SET, India.

                        Obviously Sony-owned, this Hindi-language channel is run by the Indian television channel of the same name.
                        
                        The channel has what you’d expect from a TV channel including full episodes of TV shows, teaser trailers, and episode clips.
                        
                        </p>
                    <h3>3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbCmjCuTUZos6Inko4u57UQ" target="_blank">Cocomelon – Nursery Rhymes</a> (93.8m subscribers)</h3>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4V1hnoy5MdA/maxresdefault.jpg">
                    <p>Our only children’s channel in the list, it’s high position represents how much young kids watch YouTube videos. The platform has become an easy way for parents to keep their kids entertained, especially with its autoplay feature. (Note: This trend isn’t always good.)

                        The channel itself has exactly what its title suggests. A huge bank of nursery rhymes about a range of subjects, featuring CGI characters and locations in a cartoonish design.</p>
                    <h3>2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie" target="_blank">PewDiePie</a> (106m subscribers)</h3>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/what-pewdiepie-was-like-before-all-the-fame/intro-1584737582.jpg">
                    <p>Our last individual YouTuber on the list is Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie.

                        By far the most famous YouTuber in the world, in part thanks to a number of controversies and his rivalry with another channel, T-Series, he’s also one of the highest earners on the platform.
                        
                        PewDiePie’s main focus is gaming, including livestreams of him playing. He also does a lot of vlogging, collaborations with other YouTubers, and his own meme review series.</p>
                    <h3>1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/aashiqui2" target="_blank">T-Series</a> (154m subscribers</h3>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/T-series-logo.svg/1200px-T-series-logo.svg.png">
                    <p>For 1,920 days PewDiePie was the most followed YouTube channel. And then came along T-Series, a record label and film production company from India. Despite PewDiePie trying his hardest to stay ahead of T-Series, he’s now far, far behind.

                        The content on the channel is a huge collections of music videos, film, clips, and trailers from T-Series creative output. Only time will tell if PewDiePie can ever retake the top spot.</p>
