        <h2>Top Christmas Games</h2>
        <h3>Dead Rising 4</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1197/11970954/3172575-trailer_deadrising4_stockingstuffer_20161220.jpg">
        <p>The Dead Rising series has been known mostly for its large list of imaginative and innovative weapons that can be found or built to fight off hordes of zombies, but nothing warms the heart quite like dressing up as Santa and shooting into a crowd of the undead with an explosive candy cane crossbow, or clubbing a corpse with a baseball bat outfitted with barbed wire and Christmas lights.

            Also, the game’s setting of a zombie-filled mall during Christmas time seems to be a very tongue-in-cheek commentary on the consumerism within the holiday period.

        <h3>NBA Jam:On Fire Edition</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.nba-live.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nbajam_ofe_60.jpg">
        <p>NBA JAM is an iconic game series that dates back to 1993. Known for having quirky bonus characters on it’s roster, the “On Fire Edition” has added some Christmas cheer to its line-up with Santa and his elves as playable characters.

            If you want to play a game that is universally praised for its fun and easy gameplay but also want to feel that you’re getting into the spirit of the season, then NBA JAM is for you. What better way to show some Christmas spirit, then to play as Santa Claus dunking on LeBron!</p>
        <h3>Overwatch</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.realsport101.com/images/ncavvykf/realsport-production/954c11a4cd4846af375a801f68ee155bd924b608-1280x720.png?rect=0,0,1279,720">
        <p>Not every game needs to strongly divert away from the original elements of the game in order to pay respect to the holiday period. Overwatch is a perfect example of this, with “Winter Wonderland”, a seasonal game expansion that offers festive character skins, snowy landscapes and brawls such as Yeti Hunter and Mei's Snowball Offensive.

            Simple but effective.
