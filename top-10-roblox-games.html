              <h2>Top 10 Roblox Games</h2>
              <p>These are the top 10 roblox games of 2020 go try playing these games for yourself.</p>
              <h3>10.Adopt Me!</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15200027/adopt-me-roblox.jpg">
              <p>Roleplaying opens up a laundry list of different ideas from fantasy to simulating real life; Adopt Me! is the latter. You can hop into Adopt Me! and begin life as a parent, or a baby, both of which have their own set of gameplay mechanics. As a parent, you have to do everything in your power to keep your baby happy such as feeding and playing. As a baby, your only job is being a kid—the easiest job in the world. Besides adopting children, you can also adopt pets, customize your home, and even run through various obstacle courses.</p>
              <h3>9.Hide and Seek Extreme</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15200010/hide-and-seek-extreme-roblox.jpg">
              <p>Hide-and-seek is fun on its own, but Hide and Seek Extreme has a mechanic that, sadly, none of us had when growing up: superpowers. The concept is simple: there are hiders and seekers. Hiders hide from the seekers, and the seekers look for the hiders. To add to the Extreme, seekers can choose various loadouts such as stunning hiders, throwing glue, sprinting, and even placing cameras around the map.</p>
              <h3>8.Murder Mystery 2</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15195955/murder-mystery-2-roblox.jpg">
              <p>Murder Mystery 2 is a “whodunit” game, where three different classes aim to survive, but each has their own role. As the Sheriff, you need to figure out who the murderer is. This proves difficult considering as many as 11 other players are in the room with you.As the murderer, your goal is to kill everyone, including the sheriff, without getting caught. By using a knife, you can stealthily kill off innocent players. If you’re an innocent person, not only do you need to survive, but it’s advantageous for you and the sheriff to work together to uncover the murderer.</p>
              <h3>7.Welcome to Bloxburg</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15195925/bloxburg-roblox.jpg">
              <p>Anyone who’s a fan of The Sims series will love Welcome to Bloxburg. This is a life simulator that provides players with the opportunity to build their own home, seek out a career, and keep their character’s mood up.</p>
              <h3>6.Work at a Pizza Place</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15195911/work-at-a-pizza-place-roblox.jpg">
              <p>After playing Work at a Pizza Place, you’ll understand what it’s like to be a pizza maker, cashier, delivery guy, and a pizza boxer (no, you aren’t beating on pizza). The most fun can be had as a delivery guy, where you can flex your Squidward-like attitude on customers. When you’ve had your fill working at Builder Brothers’ Pizza, you can relax in your own home. And in The Sims fashion, customize it with your hard-earned cash.</p>
              <h3>5.Theme Park Tycoon 2</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15195334/them-park-tycoon-2-roblox.jpg">
              <p>This game is perfect for any fans of the Roller Coaster Tycoon or Planet Coaster franchises. Players get to build and run their own theme park in any way they please.

              <h3>4.Zombie Attack</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15195312/zombie-attach-roblox.jpg">
              <p>This game is reminiscent of the zombie mode from Call of Duty. A team of survivors has to work together to survive as long as possible against endless waves of zombies. The waves become increasingly difficult as the game wears on. The survivors have access to knives and guns to chip away at the zombie horde in their fight to survive.</p>
              <h3>3.Flee the Facility</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15194713/flle-the-facility-roblox.jpg">
              <p>This is a thrilling horror game reminiscent of SCP: Secret Laboratory. Players need to work together to escape the facility before becoming victims of the roaming beast. The player designated as the beast at the beginning of the game will try to nab up players and force them into cryogenic stasis. Players will need to hack into computers scattered throughout the facility to unlock the exit and escape.</p>
              <h3>2.Tower Defense Simulator</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15195258/tower-defense-roblox.jpg">
              <p>This game simulates a game similar to Bloons TD or Plants VS Zombies. The game is a pretty straight forward premise. You build up defensive towers to prevent an ever-growing number of enemies from breaking through to your base. You can purchase more towers to build as you defeat more enemies. Unlike most other tower defense games, this is a multiplayer version that allows players to collaborate to stop the encroaching horde of enemies.</p>
              <h3>1.Scuba Diving at Quill Lake</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15195241/quill-lake-roblox.jpg">

The large world allows players to have their own unique adventure with just a little imagination.</p>
