              <h2>Top 10 Roblox Games</h2>
              <p>These are the top 10 roblox games of 2020 go try playing these games for yourself.</p>
              <h3>10.Adopt Me!</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="https://assets.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15200027/adopt-me-roblox.jpg">
              <p>Roleplaying opens up a laundry list of different ideas from fantasy to simulating real life; Adopt Me! is the latter. You can hop into Adopt Me! and begin life as a parent, or a baby, both of which have their own set of gameplay mechanics. As a parent, you have to do everything in your power to keep your baby happy such as feeding and playing. As a baby, your only job is being a kid—the easiest job in the world. Besides adopting children, you can also adopt pets, customize your home, and even run through various obstacle courses.</p>
              <h3>9.Hide and Seek Extreme</h3>

              <p>Hide-and-seek is fun on its own, but Hide and Seek Extreme has a mechanic that, sadly, none of us had when growing up: superpowers. The concept is simple: there are hiders and seekers. Hiders hide from the seekers, and the seekers look for the hiders. To add to the Extreme, seekers can choose various loadouts such as stunning hiders, throwing glue, sprinting, and even placing cameras around the map.</p>
              <h3>8.Murder Mystery 2</h3>

              <p>Murder Mystery 2 is a “whodunit” game, where three different classes aim to survive, but each has their own role. As the Sheriff, you need to figure out who the murderer is. This proves difficult considering as many as 11 other players are in the room with you.As the murderer, your goal is to kill everyone, including the sheriff, without getting caught. By using a knife, you can stealthily kill off innocent players. If you’re an innocent person, not only do you need to survive, but it’s advantageous for you and the sheriff to work together to uncover the murderer.</p>
